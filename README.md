# House-Price-Prediction-Project
The project aims to accurately predict the prices of houses using machine learning techniques. The data was sourced from Kaggle.com, and analytics-driven approach was applied that included data mining, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model building using Linear Regression and Random Forest algorithms.

# Project Highlights
Achieved 79.5% R-Squared and 76.9% Adjusted R-Squared on test data.
Analytics pipeline included Data Mining, Exploratory Data Analysis, and Model Training.
Multiple regression models tested: Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor.

# Technologies Used
Python
Pandas, NumPy – data preprocessing & manipulation
Matplotlib, Seaborn – data visualization and EDA
Scikit-learn – machine learning models and evaluation metrics
